# DPSCopyableLabel

A simple `UILabel` subclass that allows the label's text to be copied to the system clipboard with a long-press gesture.

The `CopyableLabel` instance can be created in code or in Interface Builder. Be sure to `import DPSCopyableLabel` when creating in code. See the Demo project for reference.
